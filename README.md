# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic dataset
This repository contains the code for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python and the Pandas library based on my [blog post](https://jrprasanna.com/2023/01/18/exploring-the-titanic-disaster-an-introduction-to-exploratory-data-analysis/). The EDA provides insights into the structure of the dataset and the distribution of the target variable, which is the 'Survived' column.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

  1. Python 3
  2. Pandas
  3. Numpy
  4. Matplotlib
  5. Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

  `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`

## Running the code
The code for the EDA can be found in the file EDA.ipynb. To run the code, simply navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal and open jupyter notebook or jupyterlab and access the file.

This will perform the EDA and display the results.

## Conclusion
This repository demonstrates the power of Exploratory Data Analysis in gaining insights and understanding of a dataset.
